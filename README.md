# AVToolkit

A simple set of classes making it easier to deal with audio/video on iOS 6+.

## Version/stability

Very alpha stage at the moment. Still a work in progress, though users have started testing it.

## TODO

* When stopped before reaching end, start at the correct position when resumed (if it isn't a livestream)
* Clean up the code
